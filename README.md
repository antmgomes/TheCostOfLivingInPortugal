This project compares the rise in housing prices (for both rent and sale) across Portuguese districts with wage growth from 2015 to 2024, while also providing an insight into the evolution of the number of tourist accommodations.

Key Insights:
Housing prices increased far faster than wages.
Several districts saw prices double or triple.
A high share of minimum wage workers worsens affordability.

Proposed Solutions:
More affordable housing.
Regulate short-term rentals.
Improve wages and regional development.

Future Work:
Add forecasting.
Include more economic factors.
Turn the dashboard into an interactive tool.

Conclusion
The data clearly shows a widening gap between income and housing costs in Portugal, highlighting a growing affordability crisis.

(18/12/2025 - I added data related to the Number of Tourist Accommodations and updated the Tableau with the evolution of that number over the years. I also created a new dashboard on Tableau that allows the user to compare the selected metric between two districts over the years.)
