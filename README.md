This project compares the rise in housing prices (both rent and sale) across Portuguese districts with wage growth from 2015 to 2024.

Key Insights:
Housing prices increased far faster than wages
Several districts saw prices double or triple
A high share of minimum wage workers worsens affordability

Proposed Solutions:
More affordable housing
Regulate short-term rentals
Improve wages and regional development

Future Work:
Add forecasting
Include more economic factors
Turn the dashboard into an interactive tool

Conclusion
The data clearly shows a widening gap between income and housing costs in Portugal, highlighting a growing affordability crisis.
